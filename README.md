## Hi, I’m Amith 👋

I’m an Applied Machine Learning & AI–focused student engineer interested in building end-to-end, reproducible ML systems, spanning classical ML, deep learning, and modern LLM-based pipelines.

---

###  Current Focus
- End-to-end ML systems: training, evaluation, optimization, and deployment
- Reproducible experimentation using MLflow and DVC
- Transformer-based models, fine-tuning, and evaluation
- Multimodal and domain-specific ML systems (vision with language)

## 📌 Featured Work

**Two-Stage Fraud Detection MLOps System**  
Made a production-style ML system with probabilistic routing (Logistic Regression -> XGBoost), MLflow experiment tracking, frozen model artifacts, FastAPI inference service, audit logging, and Docker-ready deployment.

**DermaPal**  
Multimodal AI system for dermatology combining CNN-based image classification with Grad-CAM–based visual explanations to improve clinical interpretability.

**SmartSumm**  
Abstractive text summarization system using FLAN-T5, including fine-tuning, ONNX-based quantization, and Hugging Face deployment.

**Reproducible MLOps Pipeline (DVC + MLflow)**  
Versioned data, experiments, and model artifacts with reproducible training and evaluation workflows (hosted on DAGsHub).

**RAG / Multi-Document QA Systems**  
Retrieval-augmented generation pipelines for multi-PDF analysis and question answering using transformer models.

*(See pinned repositories below)*

I focus on building **clear, measurable, and reproducible ML systems**, with emphasis on evaluation, system design, and iterative improvement and particularly interested in rigorous evaluation, representation learning, and building systems that support principled ML research.
